# Algorithm Visualizer

This project is an interactive algorithm visualizer built using Python. It allows users to visualize various algorithms, including sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and dynamic programming algorithms. The visualization helps in understanding how each algorithm works step-by-step.

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort.
- Visualize searching algorithms: KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Search.
- Visualize graph algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm.
- Visualize Fibonacci Sequence.
- Explanatory text detailing each step of the algorithms.
- Initial input and array display for better understanding.
- A responsive GUI with a scrollable list of algorithms.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you will need to install the following Python packages:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `collections`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
